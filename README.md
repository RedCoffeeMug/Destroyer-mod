# Destroyer Mod V0.1

**Not a fully finished build! may contain bugs and no textures**
***

## what I've added:
### turrets:

- GroundBreaker. "A turret that shoots giant bullets and causes mini earthquakes to stop enemys."
- SkyStriker. "A basic but strong anti-air turret, made to destroy any pesky air units."
### units:
- Colony. "A flying unit that works better in groups."
- Swarm. "A upgraded unit from Colony. Once killed this unit spawns in Colonys to help."
- Barrier. "A ground unit that does not attack but acts as a shield to other units"
### other:
- Destroyer factory "Produces tier 1 units from this mod."
- Prota Reconstructor "Reconstructs tier 1 units into tier 2 units."
